# Fake Anime Face Generation - DCGAN

![Alt text](ezgif-1-66116810d3.gif)

## Objective üéØ

The objective of the project is to generate images of Anime faces using a Deep Convolutional GAN.
The DCGAN has two networks, the 'generator' and the 'discriminator'.
The generator takes in a random vector which then uses transposed convolutions to generate an image out of it.
The discriminator is a Convolutional network which then classifies whether an image is real or fake. It takes in samples of images from the dataset and also images generated by the generator.
Both networks try to improve each other's performance through backpropagation.
